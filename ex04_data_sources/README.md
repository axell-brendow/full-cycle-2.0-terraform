## Using the local provider to create a file with variable content

Local provider resources: https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/local/latest/docs/resources/file

```sh
terraform init  # Starts a new project
terraform apply
```

Output should be similar to:

```
data-source-result = "Data source example!"
```
